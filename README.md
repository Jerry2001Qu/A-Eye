## Problem Description
Many individuals who are legally blind may be able to make out vague shapes in their vision, but can not determine the identity of that object due to excessive bluriness.

## App
The app was made for Android, using Android Studio. It consists of one activity (screen), with a live view of your phone's camera, and the ability to detect an object in that live view. You can download and use my app on the Google Play store. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amitshekhar.tflite

## Convolutional Neural Network
The CNN is MobileNet, retrained on common objects. The number of labels is a bit over 1000, but many labels consist of objects an individual would not normally see in their daily life.

## Download
Feel free to download the code and compile it on Android Studio for yourself. The app is available on the Google Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amitshekhar.tflite
